# Docker Build Failure due to Missing Dependencies

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Docker images: failure to correctly specify dependencies in the `Dockerfile`, leading to build errors.

## Problem

The provided `Dockerfile` attempts to install a Python application. However, it may fail if the application has dependencies not correctly specified in `requirements.txt` or if system packages needed by the application or dependencies are not explicitly installed using `apt-get` before `pip3` attempts to install them.

## Solution

The corrected `Dockerfile` in this repository addresses these issues by ensuring all necessary system packages and Python dependencies are correctly installed.  This is achieved through careful use of `apt-get` and `pip3`, along with clear instructions for managing dependencies.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Attempt to build the original `Dockerfile` using `docker build -t my-app .` This should fail. 
4. Build the fixed Dockerfile `docker build -t my-app-fixed -f Dockerfile.fixed .` This should build successfully.
